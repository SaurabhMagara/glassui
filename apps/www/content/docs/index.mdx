title: Introduction
description: A collection of beautifully designed, customizable components for your next project. Open source and ready to use.
---

Welcome to our component collection! This is a curated set of reusable components that you can easily integrate into your projects.

**Note**: This library is heavily inspired by [https://ui.shadcn.com](https://ui.shadcn.com). We've built upon their excellent work to create our own collection of components.

**What makes this collection unique?**

While inspired by shadcn/ui and other component libraries, our approach offers a similar philosophy with our own unique twist. We provide you with a collection of components that you can copy, paste, and customize to fit your specific needs.

## Key Features

- **Copy and Paste**: Simply copy the components you need and paste them into your project.
- **Customizable**: The code is yours to modify and adapt as you see fit.
- **Open Source**: Free to use for both personal and commercial projects.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Compatible with any React-based framework.

## Future Plans

We're constantly working to improve and expand our collection. Here are some exciting features on our roadmap:

- **CLI Tool**: We're planning to develop a command-line interface to make component integration even easier.
- **More Components**: We'll be adding new components regularly to cover a wide range of use cases.
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Detailed guides and examples to help you make the most of each component.
