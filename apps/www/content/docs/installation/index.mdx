### Overview

GlassUI Components are designed specifically for **React** and developed using **TypeScript**. They utilize **tailwindcss** for styling and **framer-motion** along with CSS for animations. GlassUI Components seamlessly integrate with the shadcn ecosystem.

### Prerequisites

To get started, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss@latest clsx tailwind-merge framer-motion
```

Next, integrate shadcn if you dont have it already:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

### Component Installation

You're ready to go! Visit any [component](/components) page and follow the provided instructions.

Just copy and paste the components you needâ€”no unnecessary bloat or third-party dependencies.
