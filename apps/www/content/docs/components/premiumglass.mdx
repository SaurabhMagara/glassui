## Customization

The `PremiumGlass` component can be customized by modifying the `features` array in the component file. Each object in the array represents a pricing tier with the following properties:

- `name` (string): The name of the pricing tier
- `price` (string): The price of the tier
- `items` (string[]): An array of features included in the tier

Example:

```tsx
const features = [
  { name: "Basic", price: "49", items: ["Core Features", "Email Support", "1 User"] },
  { name: "Pro", price: "99", items: ["All Basic Features", "Priority Support", "5 Users", "Analytics"] },
  { name: "Enterprise", price: "299", items: ["All Pro Features", "24/7 Support", "Unlimited Users", "Custom Integration"] },
]
```

You can also adjust the styling by modifying the CSS in the `<style>` tag within the component.
