## Component Details

The `HolographicPricing` component is a stylish pricing section with 3D card effects. It includes:

- A background lamp effect
- Three pricing tiers: Hobby, Pro Plan, and Unlimited
- 3D card containers with hover effects
- Pricing details and feature lists for each tier
- Call-to-action buttons

This component uses the following sub-components:

- `LampComponent`: Creates the background lamp effect
- `CardContainer`, `CardBody`, `CardItem`: Provide the 3D card functionality

The component is responsive and adjusts its layout for different screen sizes.

## Customization

To customize the pricing tiers, features, or styling, you can modify the content within each `CardBody` component. The `CardItem` components are used to create the 3D effect for different elements within the card.

You can adjust the colors, text, and layout by modifying the className props and the content of each card.
