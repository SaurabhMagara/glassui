## Features

The `AnimatedNetwork` component provides the following features:

- Responsive canvas that adjusts to window size
- Interactive dots that respond to mouse movement
- Dynamic connections between dots
- Theme-aware coloring (light and dark mode support)
- Subtle pulsing effect on dots

## Customization

You can customize the `AnimatedNetwork` component by modifying the following variables in the component:

- `dotCount`: Number of dots in the network
- `moveRadius`: Radius of influence for mouse interaction
- `connectionDistance`: Maximum distance for drawing connections between dots
- `lightColors` and `darkColors`: Arrays of colors for light and dark themes

## Notes

- The component uses the `useTheme` hook from `next-themes` for theme awareness. Make sure to set up your theme provider accordingly.
- The canvas is set to `z-0`, allowing you to place content on top of it using higher z-index values.
